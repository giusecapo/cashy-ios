# Cashy for iOS - payments made easy
iOS application for in-store payments with iPhone, using TouchID and credit/debit card.

**I made this app as my high school IT degree project**

I was one of the first developer in Italy to design and build this kind of applications (to data, Satispay is the leading company in Italy for digital in-store payments).

Development was so funny (I was just 18)!
